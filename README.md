# Automatic SMS Scheduler

## 📌 Project Overview

**Automatic SMS Scheduler** is a full-stack application designed to create, manage, and execute **SMS campaigns** in a scheduled and automated manner. The platform allows users to define SMS campaigns, control when they run, and manage recipient lists (shoppers) to whom messages are sent. The system uses **queue-based processing** to ensure reliable and scalable message delivery.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Create and manage **SMS campaigns**
* Schedule campaigns to run **on demand or at a specific time**
* Add and manage **shoppers (recipients)** using email IDs
* Asynchronous SMS processing using **Redis-based queues**
* Secure authentication using **JWT**
* Scalable and production-ready backend architecture

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Node.js (Express)**
* **MongoDB**
* **BullMQ (Redis)**
* **JWT Authentication**

### Frontend

* **React (Vite)**
* **Tailwind CSS**

---

## 🖥️ Backend Setup

This service handles campaign creation, scheduling logic, queue processing, and data persistence.

### How to Run the Backend

1️⃣ Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd datmanBackend
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3️⃣ Create a `.env` file and configure environment variables:

```env
PORT=your_port
MONGOURI=your_mongodb_uri
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
REDIS_HOST_URL=your_redis_host_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MAIL=your_email
MAILPASS=your_email_password
```

4️⃣ Start the backend server:

```bash
cd src && nodemon index.js
```

### Important Notes

* Ensure the `.env` file is correctly configured.
* **Redis must be running** for queue-based campaign processing.

## 🖥️ Frontend Setup

The frontend provides an interface to create SMS campaigns, schedule executions, and manage shoppers.

### How to Run the Frontend

1️⃣ Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd datmanFrontend
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3️⃣ Create a `.env` file and add the API base URL:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=your_base_api_url
```

4️⃣ Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Application Flow

1. Create an **SMS campaign**
2. Add **shoppers (recipients)** using email IDs
3. Schedule the campaign or trigger it manually
4. Jobs are queued using **BullMQ**
5. SMS messages are processed and sent asynchronously

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Campaign analytics and delivery reports
* Retry handling for failed SMS jobs
* Role-based access control
* Support for additional notification channels

---

## 📄 License

This project is for learning and internal use. Licensing can be added as required.
